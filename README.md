## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Run dev server**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog-starter/
    npm run develop

    # Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1.  **Deploy âœ¨**

    The website is hosted with [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/cmolina-blog/overview).

    ```sh
    # build prod assets
    npm run build

    # serve prod assets
    npm run serve

    # Checkout http://localhost:9000/,
    # then stop the server and push to prod!
    npm run deploy
    ```


## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
